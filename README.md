**NOXVISION: AI-POWERED SMART CCTV SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM**  
**Final Year Project **  

---

### **1. Introduction**  
#### **1.1 Problem Statement**  
Traditional CCTV systems face critical limitations:  
- **Passive Monitoring:** Reliance on human operators leads to missed threats.  
- **No Intelligent Analysis:** Inability to detect anomalies (fires, weapons) in real-time.  
- **Storage Inefficiency:** Continuous recording wastes storage on irrelevant footage.  
- **Lack of Customization:** Fixed functionality regardless of deployment context (e.g., traffic vs. retail).  

NoxVision addresses these gaps by integrating **Edge AI, multi-camera analytics, and automated reporting** to create a proactive surveillance solution.

### **2. Objectives**  
1. Develop a **real-time threat detection system** (fire, weapons, perimeter breaches).  
2. Implement **AI-based video summarization** to reduce storage costs.  
3. Provide **location-specific modules** (traffic, retail, industrial).  
4. Generate **natural language incident reports** using scene captioning.
