**Smart CCTV System (NoxVision)** project covering all necessary aspects:

### **1. Problem Statement**  
**Current Challenges in Traditional CCTV Systems:**  
-  **Inefficient Monitoring:** Humans can’t monitor 24/7; miss critical events.  
-  **No Proactive Alerts:** Systems lack real-time threat detection (fire, weapons).  
-  **High Storage Waste:** Stores useless footage (no summarization).  
-  **Limited Intelligence:** Cannot analyze scenes (e.g., traffic violations, object descriptions).  
-  **Location-Specific Needs:** Schools, stores, and traffic require different AI features.

### **2. Our Solution: NoxVision**  
A **Smart AI-Powered CCTV System** that:  
✅ **Processes live feeds** from multiple cameras using **Edge AI** (reduces latency).  
✅ **Detects threats early** (fire, weapons, perimeter breaches).  
✅ **Provides video summaries** (only stores clips with human activity).  
✅ **Generates descriptive alerts** (e.g., *“Red car ran red light at 9:00 PM”*).  
✅ **Customizable features** per client (traffic vs. retail vs. industrial).
