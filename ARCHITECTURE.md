NoxVision is designed as a modular surveillance system with the following components:

1. **Frontend Interface** (this prototype)
   - Dashboard view
   - Alert management
   - Configuration panels
   - Reporting system
   - Settings management

2. **Backend Services** (conceptual)
   - Video processing pipeline
   - AI detection models
   - Alert generation engine
   - Data storage layer
   - API services
